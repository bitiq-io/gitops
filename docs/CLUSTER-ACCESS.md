# Cluster Access (prod)

This repo does not store kubeconfigs. Use the kubeconfig generated by the
`signeting/clusters` repo for the prod cluster.

Kubeconfig path (prod):

```
/Users/pac/repos/github.com/signeting/clusters/clusters/prod/.work/kubeconfig
```

Rules

- Do not copy the kubeconfig into this repo.
- Do not print kubeconfig contents.
- Prefix every `oc` command with the `KUBECONFIG` env var so you do not
  accidentally use another context.

Examples

```bash
KUBECONFIG=/Users/pac/repos/github.com/signeting/clusters/clusters/prod/.work/kubeconfig oc whoami
KUBECONFIG=/Users/pac/repos/github.com/signeting/clusters/clusters/prod/.work/kubeconfig oc get nodes
KUBECONFIG=/Users/pac/repos/github.com/signeting/clusters/clusters/prod/.work/kubeconfig oc get clusterversion version
```
