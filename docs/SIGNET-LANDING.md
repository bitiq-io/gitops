# Signet Landing Source

- Repository: https://github.com/signeting/signet-landing (private, Vite/React static site for signet.ing)
- Origin: extracted from `signet-trailer/` in this repo on 2025-02-08.
- Status: static-only; GitOps re-integration (chart/pipeline) tracked in `docs/SIGNET-SIGNUP-PLAN.md` (S1+).

Use the new repo for any landing-page UI changes. This repo should only contain deployment plumbing for the site going forward.
