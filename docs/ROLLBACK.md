# Rollback Runbook

Operational recipe for reverting deployments managed by this GitOps repo. Applies to all environments (`ENV=local|sno|prod`) managed by the `bitiq-umbrella-<env>` Argo CD Applications.

## Prerequisites

- Local clone with write access to the tracked Git branch.
- `git` and `argocd` CLI (or access to the Argo Web UI) configured for the target cluster.
- Awareness of the deterministic conventions in [`docs/CONVENTIONS.md`](./CONVENTIONS.md).

## 1. Identify the release to roll back

1. Inspect recent Git history for the Application values and composite fingerprint:

   ```bash
   git log -p -- charts/bitiq-sample-app/values-<env>.yaml charts/bitiq-umbrella/Chart.yaml
   ```

2. Verify the currently deployed fingerprint in Argo (CLI or UI):

   ```bash
   argocd app get bitiq-umbrella-<env> --refresh --hard-refresh | rg '^App Version:'
   ```

   The `App Version` output matches the composite grammar `<svc>-vX.Y.Z-commit.<sha>_...`.

## 2. Revert the offending change

1. Use Git to revert the commit (preferred) or manually edit the values back to the desired versions:

   ```bash
   git revert <commit-sha>
   # or edit values-<env>.yaml and Chart.yaml manually
   ```

2. If you edited manually, recompute the composite `appVersion` so it aligns with the image tags that will be restored:

   ```bash
   make compute-appversion ENV=<env>
   ```

3. Check the diff to confirm both `values-<env>.yaml` and `Chart.yaml` now reflect the target image tags and composite fingerprint:

   ```bash
   git diff
   ```

4. Commit and push the rollback:

   ```bash
   git commit -am "revert: restore <service> to vX.Y.Z-commit.<sha>"   # include context in the message
   git push origin <branch>
   ```

## 3. Trigger Argo CD to sync

1. Allow auto-sync to converge or run a manual sync for faster recovery:

   ```bash
   argocd app sync bitiq-umbrella-<env>
   ```

2. Watch the sync and health status until the Application is `Synced` and `Healthy`:

   ```bash
   argocd app wait bitiq-umbrella-<env> --timeout 300
   ```

   Alternatively, tail the controller logs:

   ```bash
   oc logs -n openshift-gitops deploy/argocd-application-controller -f
   ```

## 4. Verify the rollback

1. Confirm Argo reports the expected composite fingerprint:

   ```bash
   argocd app get bitiq-umbrella-<env> | rg '^App Version:'
   ```

2. Inspect the rendered manifest (optional) to double-check the tag:

   ```bash
   argocd app manifest bitiq-umbrella-<env> | rg 'image:'
   ```

3. Hit the service endpoint or run smoke checks (if available):

   ```bash
   make smoke ENV=<env>
   ```

## 5. Post-rollback follow-up

- Create an issue/ADR if the rollback surfaced a systemic problem (pipeline, testing gap, etc.).
- Update monitors or status pages if customers were impacted.
- If the reverted commit introduced multiple services, ensure each serviceâ€™s values were restored and reflected in the composite fingerprint.
